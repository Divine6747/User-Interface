# User Interface Project â€“ Antivirus Defender (AVD)
As part of my first-year User Interface module, I designed the UI for a fictional antivirus application called Antivirus Defender (AVD). I researched popular antivirus software and studied a range of login and sign-up interfaces to guide my design choices.

I used Adobe Photoshop throughout the project, which helped refine my layout, icons, and overall user experience.
