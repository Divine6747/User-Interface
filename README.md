# User Interface Project
This is my final project from my first year in the User Interface module, where we were tasked with designing the UI for an application of our choice. 
I chose to create an antivirus application. To create my design, I researched various antivirus applications and studied different login/sign-up pages related to and unrelated applications.

Throughout the course, I learned to use Photoshop, which significantly helped my design process for this and other projects.
