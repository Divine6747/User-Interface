# User Interface Project
This was the final project from my first year in the User Interface module, where we were tasked with designing the UI for an application of our choice. 
I chose to create an antivirus application. To make the UI for this Application, I researched various antivirus applications and studied different login/sign-up pages related to and unrelated to applications.

I named it Antivirus Defender (AVD) for short.

Throughout the course, I learned to use Photoshop, which significantly helped my design process for this and other projects.
